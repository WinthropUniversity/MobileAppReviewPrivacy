incredible app that sucks your wallet and your data
Beautifully written app that follows the principles of tetris only in the \\&34;blitz\\&34; fashion. However, it uses Facebook as another means of data mining and selling other games as well as coins to increase your score. Be wary of this app because to truly get the high scores you will need to spend money to purchase the power ups of the game. Brilliant marketing game that is done very well, but this is not a game to entertain as much as it is to profit EA. Two stars for great programming.
