*Flurry. con own statement of data collection: Gives the age, gender, and interests of your audience. We reveal your app audience affinity to other app preferences (so they're probing and reporting what apps you have?).<br />*Developers, please use Flurry in the free versions of your apps and let pay versions be the refined clean code.<br />*No app installed on devices that I keep personal information, with Flurry on board - even faotd costs too much. Too bad too, looks like a good app.
