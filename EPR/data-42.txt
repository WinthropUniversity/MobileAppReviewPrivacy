DO NOT ALLOW YOUR CHILD TO DOWNLOAD!
I am very disappointed that Amazon carries this app as it is clearly an app used by pedophiles to lure in children.  It asks children personal questions through a talking animal (such as who lives in your home, what is your name, what city do you live it, etc).  I am now very cautious about my children downloading anything.
