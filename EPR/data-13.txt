Power sucking privacy invader
I have used this for years and am an Amazon prime member.  The newest version now also wants access to my contacts.  WHY is that necessary for me to buy something?  The ever increasing reach into my personal data combined with power draw (Typically 4% off my power even with no use of the app) convinced me to remove the app.  If anyone out there in Amazon marketing is reading this, please reduce the invasiveness and let us know.
