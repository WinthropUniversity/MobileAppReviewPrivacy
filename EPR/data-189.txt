Permissions are unacceptable
No game should need my contact list, my billing information, information about what other things I've been doing recently, etc... This is way over the top and should NOT be ignored. (And I'm not usually one of these anti-permissions people.) I'm disappointed in you Amazon... for a Free App you could at least make sure you're not promoting a data-mining application.
