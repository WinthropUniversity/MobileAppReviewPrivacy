Essential
This is one of the most useful apps on my phone. While it needs a data connection to retrieve the definitions, it is faster in my opinion than searching for the same thing through your phone's browser. Additionally, the app can provide audible pronunciations and a thesaurus (without requiring a separate program). This is essential to any student, but is also convenient for anyone who wants or needs access to a dictionary on the go! Runs smoothly on my Droid 2 Global w/ Froyo (Android 2.2).
