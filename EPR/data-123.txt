Great strategy game!
I don't see the problem that everyone else has with this app.... yes, it does ask for permission to use your GPS location, but the solution is simple. Agree to the terms. And if you don't want your information shared, turn the GPS on your phone OFF! It isn't that hard. If the GPS is off, they don't know where you are, and the game still works just fine. It is a good strategy game and a lot of fun. People shouldn't give it such bad reviews just because they are too stupid to turn their GPS off..
