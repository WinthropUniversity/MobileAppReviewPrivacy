invasive permissions required
I used to have Evernote on my iPhone when I was unaware of its invasive use of user data. I was going to het the app for my Eco until I read all of their unnecessary and invasive permission requirements. No thanks.   I'd rather pay a few dollars for an app than have it be free and invasive.
