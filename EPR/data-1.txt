This Underground app comes with a cost... too high for me
This could be an OK app, but the Amazon Underground version of it isn't free by any stretch of the imagination.  Before you can run the app, it demands that you activate app tracking.  Sorry, but I value my privacy more than some &#34;app&#34;.  Data tracking stays off, and the App gets uninstalled. There's plenty of photo editors that don't demand I give up my privacy.  Fail!
