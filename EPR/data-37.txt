HOLY SPYWARE, BATMAN!!!
This app looked interesting and Amazon was actually promoting it on the Kindle daily selections. I got suspicious when it asked to accept its Terms and Conditions before using the game. Amid tons of legal jargon lies their Privacy Policy which gives access to your personal info and that they may give it to third parties. Some of these things include your DOB and social security #...YIKES! If you decline, you may not play. Thanks, but no thanks  - time to hit delete!
