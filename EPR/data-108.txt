Facebook sign in
Once again another app that only allows you to sign up with a Facebook account. Some people don't want to use Facebook! It seems that Facebook is slowly trying to insert itself in every thing we do app wise. I'm not sure why I can't just sign up the normal way. Well that was silly I do know the real reason of this &ldquo;free&quot; app.....to advertise to me and all of my Facebook friends, rarely do we get anything for free anymore without having to give something in return !!!! I uninstalled!
