Wild Permissions!
Why any game would need these permissions is beyond me.  The only reason for these would be to share your personal information with the author (and then who else?)<br /><br />I've seen some sneaky permissions over the years, but this author didn't even try to hide the fact he's going to steal your info.<br /><br />Advice: do not install.
