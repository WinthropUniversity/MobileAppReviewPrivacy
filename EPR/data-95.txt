Red flag with permissions!
I really liked this app a lot . It was just what I needed an at a glance monthly  calendar that is simple to use and  I did not need to be online to view the calendar. The problem I found with this app was it seemed very odd that in the permission section it says it needs REQUIRED access to my camera!  WHY would it need access to my camera??? I'm going to uninstall this app  because any app that can  turn my camera on at any given time is a privacy concern and kinda creepy.
