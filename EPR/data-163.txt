crackle not worth it
crackle has a poor selection of movies, not many to chose from and most are pretty old. it's for adults only in my opinion. if you give them your personal info they admittedly use cookies to track what you do online. when I did attempt to watch a movie, the app stopped working and I didn't feel like messing w it anymore. I deleted crackle. if you chose to sign up for it I suggest you read their disclaimers on how they use your personal info.
