BEWARE!
I really want people to be aware of the dangers in downloading this app. Check the permissions. They are many and invasive. There is no wonder so many people claim it stops working. It is probably some type of spyware or adware. None the less, it will more than likely load junk detrimental to your device. Amazon has a habit of including these apps as the faotd.I always check the permissions from apps, especially the faotd apps. I recommend everyone to do the same.
