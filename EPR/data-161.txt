some problems
This is a good game. But i think the craters should change the chat in multiplayer. People are giving out phone numbers and their ages, and thats NOT ok. That has to get done. And also the controls are hard to use.... i think you just have to get used to it. And one more thing..... sometime when my daughter trys to join one of her worlds it says it can't access it. And to the multilayer fans DO NOT GIVE AWAY PERSONAL INFORMATION!!!!
