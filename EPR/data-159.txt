Concerned about data consumption-connects to social network
I never got to play with it, as soon as it wanted to connect to social networks and I couldn't get out of the section I uninstalled the app. If it's forcing you to sign into your facebook/twitter/etc accounts, I wonder just how much data it will use and what it publishes (I don't want my activities published)
