Another app with intrusive unnessary permissions
Why does any image app need to collect your location, your WiFi info, your network info, and the inclusion of flurry analytics should be a red flag for all users, because its only purpose is to collect user data. I urge everyone to stop buying or using apps the unnecessarily collect user data like this one does.
