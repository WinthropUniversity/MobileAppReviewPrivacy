WARNING!!!    App. gains access to your contact list
If you read the info on the I agree page its asking you for access to your contact list in your email account. Im sure there are other apps that do this but this is the first Ive come across. This is way out of my comfort zone. Im just not comfortable subjecting my friends and family to their info being sold for some free slot tokens!
