infected app
Yes, its infected with the permission creep bug. Each update the infection gets worse, and amazon takes more and more private information. The average customer would have no idea that amazon is reading your private messages now. Amazon underground. More like amazon back alley. Sneaky, dirty, disgusting. Will not renew my membership. I hope and pray more customers follow my lead and affect a policy change, because I'd like to stay a member but we must not compromise our privacy for profits. Not worth it.
