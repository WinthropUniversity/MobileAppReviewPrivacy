This game is a game where you can talk to a cat named Angela. It may seem harmless but it is connected to a whole hoax that the police FBI and other people have been who have notice  that this game takes pictures of you , asks inappropriate questions and requires you to give it your name age and school. PARENTS DO NOT DOWNLOAD!<br /><br />PS: The only reason I gave it a one star is that you have to rate it to post.<br /><br />PPS: If you don't believe me, look at all the other reviews or look this up on the internet.
