funky permissions
In app billing, user contacts?<br />No. No disclosure for any kind of in app purchasing, so why is that there? And why does the cat need access to my contacts? Some of the other permissions are questionable. But these 2, I have zero interest in this app. Even as FAOTD, it's not worth compromising my information.
