data usage. looses settings.
I tried to be fair and give it a shot.  these stick figure games were very popular a couple years ago so I didn't get why there were all the bad reviews. the game play seemed about what I would expect, but could have been explained a little better.  my issues are that it did not remember setting such as sound and music being off between each time it is started, and even when turned off it still makes some sounds. worst of all it does appear to use the data network, so it must be data mining. I'm uninstalling it.
