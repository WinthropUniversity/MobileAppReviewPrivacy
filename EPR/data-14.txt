Handy but too invasive!
Handy but too invasive! I have used this app a LOT, it has extensive permissions already but, most recently is asking permission to read contact data on my devices. (Why would they need that unless they intend to spam your contacts?). I have not loaded the latest update yet and am hoping public pressure will convince Amazon to back off on the invasive permissions. One small Prime member!
