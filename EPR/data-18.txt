Excited to try then uninstalled before logging in.
I was excited to try this twist on the match 3 type of game but when I tried to log in using Facebook I changed the information that the app is allowed to access.  When you do this the app enters a loop until you choose to give it all of the info it's asking from Facebook instead of letting you choose.  I will not use an app that forces me to give it all of my information.<br /><br />If you enjoy your privacy I would suggest waiting to use the app until this loop is taken out.
