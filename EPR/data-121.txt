NO GAME SHOULD TRACK MY LOCATION!
Why is it so difficult for developers to get through their thick skulls that we have a right to our own privacy? What makes it even more disgusting is that this is a paid game. Why do you need to collect private and personal fine location data on us? The only people that don't care about these things are people with no life. I have nothing to hide but that doesn't give you a right to look.
