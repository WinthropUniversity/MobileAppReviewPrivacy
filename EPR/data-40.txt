Invasion of privacy
At first I was skeptical of the permissions of this app, but I installed it anyway. It wasn't even a moment after, everyone on my contact list was getting spam, both emails and texts. There is no reason for  app to have access to ones contacts list. Stay away from nearly any app that wants access to your contacts.
