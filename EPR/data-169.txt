Requires connection to allow Open Fent Data Mine
This is a cute game I used to enjoy by turning off the Kindle Fire's WiFi. After all, no wi-fi, no Open Feint data mining. However a recent update removed this opportunity. Now, the game will not load unless connected to the internet.<br /><br />OBVIOUS DATA MINER! Open Feint is hidden within the program so you cannot simply turn it off. If you try to remove the Open Feint account on your device, it automatically creates a new one.<br /><br />AVOID!
