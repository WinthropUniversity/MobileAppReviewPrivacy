The NSA has nothing on this app
If you thought Edward Snowden's revelation for the world was not a big deal or if you are one of those &amp;#34;if you're not hiding anything, why wouldn't you want strange faceless people rummaging through your data&amp;#34; then this is the app for you. If you value your privacy and avoid apps that ask for way too much power over your phone and data, you will avoid this app like a drag queen hooker with a five o'clock shadow and a raging case of herpes, covered in raw sewage, with a RFID scanner hanging out of his purse.
