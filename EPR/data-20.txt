Uninstalling. Ridiculous App Permissions
W.t.h. Amazon. Why do I need to install this App outside of Google Play store. No need. I cancelled Prime and don't need this ridiculous App that basically feels like malware and asks for all sorts of unnecessary permissions. These app developers should realize that we the consumers have finally begun taking notice of the way they exploit their customers by making their apps privacy nightmares. I can just use the browser to shop. Uninstalling.
