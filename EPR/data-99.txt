Very long time user, app is now totally useless due to connection requirement.
I've used this many years on Window PC and a series of Windows CE devices before smart phones existed. But now having to pay $10 for an app that will not function unless connected to Amazon is absolutely, totally unacceptable. That means I have to enter TWO IDs and TWO passwords to enter the app, and use my limited data access for absolutely no good reason. Entering one with big fingers is hard enough.<br /><br />I will be looking for another password manager. I should get a refund, it does not function as described.
