sorry but no you don't get any data from my device!
&quot;Cloud&quot; is an euphemism which basically means &quot;somebody else's server&quot;. The description lies and says that it is optional but in practice the app will not let you use it unless you agree to giving them your data. No thank you. 1 star for the deception.
