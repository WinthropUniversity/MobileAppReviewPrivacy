App seems to work alright but be aware of article 9 of the end user agreement.<br /><br />&quot;Personal Information. Pixatel reserves the right to anonymously track the usage of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and may use suitable information to provide you targeted ads and offers through this and other Pixatel applications on this device.&quot;<br /><br />Now, I find &quot;anonymously&quot; and &quot;Targeted&quot; to be an odd pairing to be used in the same sentence. In my honest opinion, please use with discretion.
