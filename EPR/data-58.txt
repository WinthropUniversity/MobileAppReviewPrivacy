Scary
As I was talking to Angela she kept on talking about Tom and she can be self centered. She can ask personal questions about yourself which feels pretty creepy. I read all the reviews before and I wanted to check it out so I kept on blocking camera as I was talking to Angela. But the weirdest thing happened was when I was on the app I got a restricted call which is scary. That's why don't download this app I immediately deleted it after I got that call. Trust me you will feel weird when your on the the app. DON'T DOWNLOAD
