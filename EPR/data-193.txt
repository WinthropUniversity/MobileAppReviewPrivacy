Wants too much info
I had this on my Kindle and it ran okay, but for the latest update it has change what pemissions you give it to include all you personal info, contacts, and just about everything else. Plus it wants the ability to make phone calls  and send SMS messages (not that you can do that with a Kindle, but imagine what else it can do with all that access. I've uninstalled it and won't be using it again.
