It's the only way to get Norton to eventually make this do what they say it does; by refunding all the customers who purchase it.","review_date":"2015-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","sentiment":{"score":-4,"comparative":-0.0547945205479452,"tokens":["truly","useless","for","kindle","","i","agree","with","the","other","reviews","a","pain","to","set","up","and","it","does","not","block","the","content","you","set","it","up","to","block<br",">very","disappointed","in","the","product","and","i","bought","the","34premium34","version","","will","be","asking","for","a","refund","","it's","the","only","way","to","get","norton","to","eventually","make","this","do","what","they","say","it","does","by","refunding","all","the","customers","who","purchase","it"],"words":["disappointed","block","pain","agree","useless"],"positive":["block","agree"],"negative":["disappointed","pain","useless"]},"classification":"privacy","otherProb":0.18402693825823763,"privacyProb":0.8159730617417624,"code1":0,"sample2":true,"classification2":"privacy","otherProb2":0.11461059939379561,"privacyProb2":0.8853894006062044,"review_body_length":378},{"_id":"5b91b66a0dfd20274a007980","marketplace":"US","customer_id":"39086633","review_id":"R2W5ENOVIFZ0KH","product_id":"B00DRWJ83S","product_parent":"389257231","product_title":"BT NumberBoard Free","product_category":"Mobile_Apps","star_rating":5,"helpful_votes":0,"total_votes":0,"vine":"N","verified_purchase":"Y","review_headline":"my preschooler likes it","review_body":"It is hard to get my preschooler to like an educational game, but she likes this one, so I can't complain.","review_date":"2013-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","sentiment":{"score":5,"comparative":0.23809523809523808,"tokens":["it","is","hard","to","get","my","preschooler","to","like","an","educational","game","but","she","likes","this","one","so","i","can't","complain"],"words":["complain","likes","like","hard"],"positive":["complain","likes","like"],"negative":["hard"]},"classification":"other","otherProb":0.5681643582699802,"privacyProb":0.43183564173001976,"code1":0,"sample3":true,"classification2":"other","otherProb2":0.6286139161630938,"privacyProb2":0.3713860838369062,"review_body_length":106},{"_id":"5b91b6600dfd20274affb239","marketplace":"US","customer_id":"18477715","review_id":"R3GY9WVXAJ4K6C","product_id":"B00EDSZZ28","product_parent":"566518437","product_title":"Scratch Blitz FREE Scratchers","product_category":"Mobile_Apps","star_rating":4,"helpful_votes":12,"total_votes":14,"vine":"N","verified_purchase":"Y","review_headline":"Late night entertainment","review_body":"I play late at night and love this because there is no thought process.

Very relaxing and soothing! The fireplace looks very realistic and the screen quality on the Kindle HD is amazing, giving the image an almost 3D quality. You can choose between various fireplace images, as well as various sound FX (which are also quite realistic). There is also an option for music to play in the background. There are no ads in this app, which is great since ads are a major source of distraction on many free apps. This app is 99&cent;, which isn't bad given what you get!","review_date":"2014-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","sentiment":{"score":18,"comparative":0.1935483870967742,"tokens":["i","love","this","app","very","relaxing","and","soothing","the","fireplace","looks","very","realistic","and","the","screen","quality","on","the","kindle","hd","is","amazing","giving","the","image","an","almost","3d","quality","you","can","choose","between","various","fireplace","images","as","well","as","various","sound","fx","which","are","also","quite","realistic","there","is","also","an","option","for","music","to","play","in","the","background","there","are","no","ads","in","this","app","which","is","great","since","ads","are","a","major","source","of","distraction","on","many","free","apps","this","app","is","99cent","which","isn't","bad","given","what","you","get"],"words":["bad","free","distraction","great","no","quality","amazing","quality","soothing","love"],"positive":["bad","free","great","quality","amazing","quality","soothing","love"],"negative":["distraction","no"]},"sample":true,"code1":0,"classification":"other","otherProb":0.8770677294397405,"privacyProb":0.12293227056025949,"subsample":true,"classification2":"other","otherProb2":0.7965584245438677,"privacyProb2":0.20344157545613234,"review_body_length":508},{"_id":"5b91b72d0dfd20274a0f8a3c","marketplace":"US","customer_id":"15318002","review_id":"R3LKMJMB1SJKJ0","product_id":"B00A0YXZVW","product_parent":"453429892","product_title":"Horse Life Adventures Free","product_category":"Mobile_Apps","star_rating":5,"helpful_votes":0,"total_votes":0,"vine":"N","verified_purchase":"Y","review_headline":"Fun for all ages","review_body":"I just started, but so far I am enjoying this game.
